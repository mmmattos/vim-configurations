Keeping few files synchronized with GIT.
=========================================

What I did to get the vim related files on my differen home directories across diferen machines to be synchronized.

First, on one pc, I set up a new empty git repo:

    C:\users\mattos> git init

then I added just the files related to vim that I want this repository to care about.

    C:\users\mattos> git add _vimrc
    C:\users\mattos> git add vim-configurations-readme.txt
    C:\users\mattos> git add vimfiles

then commited the newly added files:

    C:\users\mattos> git commit -m "<message>"

linked my local repo to the remote one:

    C:\users\mattos> git remote add origin git@github.com:mmmattos/vim-configurations.git

And finally pushed the local repo into the remote.

    C:\users\mattos> git push origin master

Now, on the second pc, I could not use close since I wanted to get just those files updated in this pc´s home directory.
To accomplish that I initialized a git repo, the very same way :

    C:\users\mmmattos> git init

Associated the same remote repository with the local one:

    C:\users\mmmattos> git remote add origin  git@github.com:mmmattos/vim-configurations.git

Fetched and pulled the files from the repository:

        C:\users\mmmattos> git fetch
        C:\users\mmmattos> git pull origin master

Files were downloaded and put in the pc home directory.

To test the setup, I modified _vimrc applying some minor change.
Once saved, I had to add the change to the local repo:
    
        C:\users\mmmattos> git add _vimrc

And finally pushed the change into the remote repository

        C:\users\mmmattos> git push origin master.

Github revealed the file was updated and the diff on the revision revealed the minor change.

That´s all folks.
